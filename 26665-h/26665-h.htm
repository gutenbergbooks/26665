<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>ACT I</h2>

<p class="scene">Autumn. A peasant's hut, with a small room partitioned off.
Akul&iacute;na sits spinning; Martha the housewife is kneading
bread; little Par&aacute;shka is rocking a cradle.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Oh dear, my heart feels heavy! I know it
means trouble; there's nothing to keep him there. It
will again be like the other day, when he went to town
to sell the firewood and drank nearly half of it. And he
blames me for everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Why look for trouble? It is still early, and
the town is a long way off. For the present&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What do you mean by early? Ak&iacute;mych is back
already. He started after Michael but Michael's not
back yet! It's worry worry all day long; that's all the
pleasure one gets.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Ak&iacute;mych took his load straight to a customer;
but our man took his to sell at the market.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> If he were alone I shouldn't worry, but Ign&aacute;t
is with him; and when he's with that <ins title="lousey">lousy</ins> hound (God
forgive me!), he's sure to get drunk. Early and late one
toils and moils. Everything is on our shoulders! If one
only got anything by it! But no! hustling about all day
long is all the pleasure one gets.</p>

<p><i>Door opens and Tar&aacute;s enters with a ragged Tramp.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306">306</a></span>
<span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Good day to you! I've brought a man who
wants a night's lodging.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>bows</i>] My respects to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Why do you bring them to us so often? We
put up a tramp last Wednesday night; you always bring
them to us. You should make Stepan&iacute;da put them up;
there are no children there. It's more than I can do to
look after my own family, and you always bring these
people to us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Everyone in turn has to put them up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> It's all very well to say &ldquo;everyone in turn,&rdquo;
but I have children, and besides, the master is not at
home to-day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Never mind, let the fellow sleep here to-night;
he'll not wear out the place he lies on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>to Tramp</i>] Come in and sit down, and be our
guest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I tender my gratitude. I should like a bite of
something, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> You haven't had time to look round, and want
to eat already. Didn't you beg anything in the village?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>sighs</i>] I'm not in the habit of begging because
of my position, and having no producks of my own&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Akul&iacute;na rises, goes to the table, takes a loaf of bread, cuts a
slice, and gives it to the Tramp.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>taking the bread</i>] <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci.</span><a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> [<i>Sits down on the bench
and eats greedily</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> And where is Michael?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Why, he took hay to the town. It's time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307">307</a></span>was back, but he's not here. Something must have
happened.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Why, what should happen?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What indeed? Not anything good; it's only
bad one has to expect. As soon as he's out of the house
he forgets all about us! I expect he'll come back
tipsy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>sitting down to spin, points at Martha and says
to Tar&aacute;s</i>] It's not in her to be quiet. As I always say,
we women must find something to grumble about.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> If he were alone I should not be afraid, but
he went with Ign&aacute;t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Ah well, Ign&aacute;t Iv&aacute;novich certainly is
fond of a drop of v&oacute;dka.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Doesn't he know what Ign&aacute;t is like! Ign&aacute;t
is one man, and our Michael's another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> It's all very well for you to talk, mother; but
I'm sick of his drinking. While he is sober it would be
a sin to complain of him, but when he's drunk, you know
what he is like. One can't say a word; everything is
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Yes, but look at you women too; a man has a
drink. Well, he swaggers about a bit, and sleeps it off,
and everything goes on all right; but then the likes of
you keep on nagging at him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> When he's drunk there's no pleasing him, do
what you will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> But you should understand that we can't help
having a drop now and then. Your woman's business is
at home, but the likes of us must have a drop when
we're on business, or for company's sake. Well, so one
drinks, and where is the harm?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> You may talk, but it's hard on us women.
Oh, how hard it is! If one harnessed you men to our
work just for a week, you would sing a different tune.
Kneading, cooking, baking, spinning, weaving, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308">308</a></span>cattle to look after, and all the rest of it, and the brats
to keep washed and clothed and fed; it's all on our
shoulders, and if anything is the least bit not to his fancy,
there you are, especially when he's drunk. Oh dear,
what a life ours is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>chewing</i>] That's quite correct. It's the cause
of it all; I mean all the catastrophes of life proceed from
alcoholic liquors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> It seems to have bowled you over too!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> No, not exactly that, though I have suffered
from that too. The career of my life might have been
different but for the drink.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> Now, to my thinking, if you drink reasonably,
there's no manner of harm in it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> But I say that it is so strong that it may completely
ruin a man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> That's what I say: you worry and do your
best, and the only comfort you get is to be scolded and
beaten like a dog.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> And that's not all. There are some people,
persons I mean, that are quite deprived of their reason
through it and commit entirely inappropriate actions.
While he does not drink, give him anything you like
and he won't take what is not his; but when drunk, he
grabs whatever comes handy. Many a time one gets
beaten and put in prison. As long as I don't drink, all
goes honestly and honourably, but as soon as I drink, I
mean as soon as that same person drinks, he at once
begins grabbing whatever comes his way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> And I think it's all in oneself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Of course it's in oneself as long as one is well,
but this is a kind of disease.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TAR&Aacute;S.</span> A nice kind of disease. A good hiding would
soon cure that disease. Well, goodbye for the present.
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>wipes her hands and turns to go</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309">309</a></span>
<span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>sees that the Tramp has finished his bread</i>] Martha,
I say, Martha! Cut him another piece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Bother him, I must get the samov&aacute;r to boil.
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><i>Akul&iacute;na rises, goes to the table, cuts a chunk of bread and
gives it to the Tramp.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci</i>, I have acquired a great appetite.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Are you a workman?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Who? I? I was a mechanic.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> And what wages did you get?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I used to get fifty, and even seventy roubles, a
month.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> That's a good lot! Then how have you come
down so low?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Come down! I'm not the only one. I've come
down because the times are such that it is impossible for
an honest man to live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>brings in the samov&aacute;r</i>] Oh Lord! it's certain
sure he'll come home drunk. I feel it in my heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> I'm afraid he must really have gone on the
spree.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> There it is. One struggles and struggles and
kneads and bakes and cooks and spins and weaves and
tends the cattle; everything on one's own shoulders.
[<i>The baby in the cradle cries</i>] Par&aacute;shka, rock the boy. Oh
dear, what a life it is for us women. And when he is
drunk, nothing is right!&hellip; If one only says a word he
doesn't like&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>making the tea</i>] And this is the last of the tea.
Did you tell him to get some?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Of course. He said he would, but he'll have
forgotten all about his home!&hellip; [<i>She puts the samov&aacute;r
on the table</i>].</p>

<p><i>The Tramp moves away.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Why do you leave the table? We are going
to drink tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311">311</a></span>
<span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I tender my gratitude for the hearty hospitality.
[<i>Throws away the cheap cigar<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he was smoking and comes to
the table</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> And what sort do you belong to? Peasants,
or some other?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Well, I'm not of the peasant class, nor of the
aristocracy. I'm of the double-edged class.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What's that? [<i>hands him a cup of tea</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci.</i> Why this; that my father was a Polish
Count, and besides him I had many others; and I also
had two mothers. In general my biography presents
many difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Have another cup? Well, did you get any
learning?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> My learning has also been very uncircumstantial.
Not my mother, but my godmother apprenticed
me to a blacksmith. That blacksmith was my first
perdagogue; and his perdagogy consisted in this&mdash;that
he did not beat his anvil as often as he beat my unfortunate
head. Nevertheless, however much he hit me,
he could not deprive me of talent. Then I went to a
locksmith's, and there I was appreciated, and became
foreman. I made acquaintance with educated people,
and belonged to a political faction. I was able to master
intellectual literature; and my life might have been
elevated for I possessed immense talent.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> But here came an upset. The despotic yoke
oppressing the life of the people! I got into prison; I
mean, I suffered the incarceration of freedom.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> For our rights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What rights?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> What rights? Why the rights that the bourgeois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310">310</a></span>should not feast continually, and that the labouring
proletariat might reap the rewards of labour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> And get back the land, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Well naturally. The Agromoric question too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> May God and the Holy Queen of Heaven
grant it. We are that pressed for land. Well, and how
are things now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Now? I am off to Moscow. I shall go to an
exploiter of labour. Can't be helped; I shall humble myself
and say&mdash;give me what work you will, only take me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Well, have some more tea.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Thank you; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">merci</i> I mean.</p>

<p><i>Noise and talk in the passage outside.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Here's Michael, just in time for tea.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>rises</i>] Oh, my goodness, Ign&aacute;t is with him!
That means he's drunk.</p>

<p><i>Michael and Ign&aacute;t stagger in.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> How are you all? [<i>Crosses himself before the icon</i>]
Here we are, damn you, just in time for tea. We went
to church, service was done; we went to dine, all eaten
and gone; to the <ins title="pub.">pub,</ins> we went in, just time to begin.
Ha, ha, ha! You give us some tea and we'll give you
some v&oacute;dka. That's fair. [<i>Laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Where has this swell come from? [<i>Points to
Tramp. Takes a bottle from the bosom of his coat and puts it
on the table</i>] Bring some cups.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Well, did you get on all right?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> Nothing could be better, damn you; drank, and
had a spree, and have brought some home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>fills the cups with v&oacute;dka, hands one to his mother
and then one to the Tramp</i>] Drink, you too!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>taking cup</i>] I offer most heartfelt thanks. Your
health. [<i>Empties the cup</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> Fine fellow, how he swills, damn him! I should
think hunger makes it run through all his veins. [<i>Pours
out some more</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312">312</a></span>
<span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>drinks</i>] I wish you success in all your undertakings.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Well, did you get a good price for the hay?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> Good or bad, we've drunk it all, damn you! Am
I right, Michael?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Why, of course. It's not made to be looked
at! One must have some fun once in a hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What are you swaggering for? There's not
much good in that. We've nothing to eat at home, and
see what you're doing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>threateningly</i>] Martha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Well, what of Martha? I know I'm Martha.
Oh, it makes me sick to look at you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Martha, look!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> There's nothing to see. I don't want to look.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Pour out the v&oacute;dka and serve it round to our
visitors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Faugh, you bleary-eyed hound. I don't want
to speak to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> You don't? Ah, you baggage, what did
you say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>rocks cradle. Par&aacute;shka is frightened and comes
to her</i>] What I said? I said I do not want to talk to you,
that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Have you forgotten? [<i>Jumps up from the table,
strikes her on the head and knocks off her kerchief</i>] One!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Oh! Oh! Oh! [<i>Runs crying to the door</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> You'll not get away, you jade! [<i>Rushes at her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>jumps up from the table and seizes his arm</i>] You have
no kind of complete right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>stops and looks at Tramp with surprise</i>] Is it long
since you had a thrashing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> You have no complete right to subject the
female sex to insults.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Oh, you son of a bitch! Do you see this?
[<i>Shows his fist</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313">313</a></span>
<span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I will not allow exploitations to be performed
on the female sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> I'll give you such an extolpation that you'll
not know which end you stand on.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Go on, strike away! Why don't you? [<i>Holds
out his face</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>shrugs his shoulders and spreads out his arms</i>]
Suppose I really go for you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I tell you, strike!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Well, you are a rum chap, now I come to
look at you. [<i>Drops his arms and shakes his head</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T</span> [<i>to Tramp</i>] One sees at once that you're pretty
sweet on the women, damn you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I stand up for their rights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>to Martha as, breathing heavily, he steps to the
table</i>] Well Martha, you must set a big candle before the
saints for his sake. But for him, I'd have beaten you to
a jelly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What else can one expect of you. One
worries all one's life, baking and cooking; and as soon
as&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Now, have done, have done! [<i>Offers v&oacute;dka to
the Tramp</i>] Drink. [<i>To his wife</i>] And what are you
slobbering for? Mayn't a fellow have his joke? There
you are [<i>gives her money</i>], put it away. Here are two
three-rouble notes and two twenty-copeck pieces.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> And the tea and sugar I wanted?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>takes parcel from his pocket and hands it to his
wife. Martha takes the money and the parcel and goes into
the little room, silently arranging the kerchief on her head</i>]
What an unreasonable lot these women are. [<i>He again
offers v&oacute;dka to the Tramp</i>] There, drink.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>declining it</i>] Drink it yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Come now, don't fuss.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>drinking</i>] Success to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T</span> [<i>to Tramp</i>] You must have seen many a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314">314</a></span>sight, I suppose. Oh, what a fine coat you've got!
Latest fashion. Where did you get it from? [<i>pointing
to Tramp's tattered jacket</i>]. Don't you mend it, it's fine as
it is! It's getting on in years, I fancy. Well, it can't
be helped. If I had one like it, the women would be
sweet on me too! [<i>To Martha</i>] Ain't that true?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> You should not, Ign&aacute;t Iv&aacute;nych. Before seeing
anything of him, why go and hold up a man to
laughter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> It comes of his uneducatedness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> I'm doing it friendly-like. Drink [<i>offers v&oacute;dka</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> He says himself&mdash;it's the cause of all evil&mdash;and
he's been in prison because of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> What were you in prison for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>very drunk</i>] I've suffered for expropriation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> What's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Why, this way. Came up to a fat paunch:
&ldquo;Give up your money, else here's a levolver.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He tries
this way and that, but forks out 2,300 roubles.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> We meant to dispose of it the proper way.
Zembrik&oacute;f was our leader. Then those ravens swooped
down on us. At once under arrest, and into prison.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> And took the money away?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> Of course. Only they could not convict me.
At the trial the procurator said these words to me:
&ldquo;You've stolen money&rdquo; says he; and I answer him
straight: &ldquo;Thieves steal, but we have performed an
expropriation for our Party.&rdquo; And he didn't know what
to say. He tried this way and that, but couldn't answer
me. &ldquo;Lead him,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to prison,&rdquo; that is&mdash;to the
incarceration of free life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> Clever dog! A regular brick! [<i>Offering v&oacute;dka</i>]
Drink, damn you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315">315</a></span>
<span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Fie, how nastily you speak!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> I, Grannie? I don't mean it for abuse; it's
a manner of speech of mine. Damn you, damn you!&hellip;
Your good health, Grannie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>returns and stands at the table pouring out tea</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> That's right. Fancy taking offence! I say,
it's thanks to him. [<i>To Tramp</i>] What do you think?
[<i>Embraces Martha</i>] I cherish my old woman. See, how
I cherish her. In a word, my old woman is first-rate.
I would not change her for anybody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IGN&Aacute;T.</span> There, that's good. Grannie, drink! I stand
treat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> What it means&mdash;the power of enershy! One
was in a state of melancholy, and now there's nothing
but pleasantness and friendly disposition. Grannie, I
feel much love for you and for everybody. Brothers dear
[<i>sings revolutionary song</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> It has got right hold of him in his <ins title="hunger">hunger.</ins></p>

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<div class="scene">
<p>Same hut. Morning</p>

<p>Martha and Akul&iacute;na. Michael is asleep</p>
</div>


<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>takes hatchet</i>] I must go and chop some firewood.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>with a pail</i>] He'd have beaten you black and
blue yesterday, had it not been for that fellow. I don't
see him. Has he gone? I suppose he has. [<i>Exit one
after the other</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>climbs down from the top of the oven</i>] Just look,
the sun's already quite high. [<i>Puts on his boots</i>] She
must have gone to fetch water with mother. How my
head aches! I won't do it again; the devil take it!
[<i>Crosses himself before the icon, prays, and then washes his
hands and face</i>] I'll go and harness.</p>

<p><i>Enter Martha with firewood.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> And yesterday's beggar? Has he gone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Must have gone. Can't see him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Oh well, let him go. He seemed a clever
chap though.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> He took your part!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> What of that!</p>

<p><i>Michael puts on his coat.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> And the tea and sugar? Did you put them
away last night, eh?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> I thought you did.</p>

<p><i>Enter Akul&iacute;na with a pail of water.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>to Akul&iacute;na</i>] Mother, have you taken the parcel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317">317</a></span>
<span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> No, I know nothing about it. I haven't
seen it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Last night, I put it on the window-sill.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Yes, I saw it there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Where can it be? [<i>They look for it</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Dear me, what a shame!</p>

<p><i>Enter Neighbour.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Well Michael Tikh&oacute;nych, are we to go for
the wood?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Yes, of course. I'm just going to harness;
but you see we've lost something.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Dear me! What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Why, you see, my old man brought a parcel
from town yesterday, with tea and sugar in it, and I put
it down here on the window-sill and didn't remember to
put it away; and now it's gone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> And we're committing the sin of suspecting
a tramp who spent the night here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> What sort of tramp?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Well, he's rather thin and has no beard.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> His coat's all in rags.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Curly hair and rather hooked nose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> Yes, yes!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I've just met him, and wondered why he
was stepping out so fast.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> It must be him. Where was he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> I don't think he can have crossed the
bridge yet.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>snatches up his cap and goes out quickly, followed
by the Neighbour</i>] I'll catch the knave. It's him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Oh, what a shame, what a shame! It's surely
him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> And suppose it's not. It happened once,
some twenty years ago, that they accused a man of
having stolen a horse. A crowd collected. One says:
&ldquo;I myself saw him catching it.&rdquo; Another says he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318">318</a></span>him leading it. It was a big piebald horse, easily noticed.
All the people began searching for it, and in the forest
they found the lad. &ldquo;It's you,&rdquo; they say. He protests
and swears it was not him. They say: &ldquo;What's the good
of listening to him; the women said quite certainly it's
him.&rdquo; Then he said something rude. George Lap&uacute;shkin
(he's dead now) was a hot-tempered man. He dashed
at him slap bang, and struck him on the mouth. &ldquo;It
was you,&rdquo; said he, and hit out at him. Then all the
others fell on him and began beating him with sticks and
fists till they killed him. And what do you think!.&hellip;
Next day the real thief was found. The lad they killed
had only gone into the forest to choose a tree to cut
down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Yes, of course, we may be sinning against him.
He has come down very low, but seemed a good fellow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> Yes, he has sunk very low. One can't expect
much from the likes of him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> They're shouting. I expect they're bringing
him back.</p>

<p><i>Enter Michael, Neighbour, an old man and a lad, pushing
the Tramp before them.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>with the parcel in his hands, excitedly to his wife</i>]
It was found on him. [<i>To Tramp</i>] You thief! You
dog!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA</span> [<i>to Martha</i>] It's him, poor soul. See how he
hangs his head.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> It seems it was himself he spoke about
yesterday that grabs anything that's handy when he's
had some drink.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I'm not a thief; I'm an expropriator. I am a
worker and must live. You can't understand it. Do
what you like with me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> Take him to the village Elder or straight
to the police!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP.</span> I tell you, do whatever you like. I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319">319</a></span>afraid, and am ready to suffer for my convictions. If you
were educated you would understand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> [<i>to her husband</i>] Suppose we let him go, in God's
name. We've got the parcel back. Let him go and let's
not commit another sin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>repeating</i>] &ldquo;Another sin!&rdquo; Taken to teaching?
One wouldn't know what to do without you, eh?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> Why not let him go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL.</span> &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo; One knows what to do without
you, you fool. &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo; Go he may, but he must
hear a word or two so that he should feel. [<i>To Tramp</i>]
Well then, listen, you sir, to what I have to say to you.
Though you are in a very low state, still you have done
very wrong&mdash;very wrong. Another man would have
caved your ribs in, and have taken you to the police;
but I will only say this. You've done wrong, as wrong
as may be; only you are in a very bad way and I don't
want to hurt you. [<i>Pauses. Everyone is silent. Then he
continues solemnly</i>] Go, and God be with you, and do not
do it again. [<i>Looks at his wife</i>] And you want to teach
me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> You shouldn't, Michael; oh, you should
not. You're encouraging that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>the parcel still in his hand</i>] Whether I should
or not is my business. [<i>To his wife</i>] And you tried to
teach me! [<i>Stops, looks at the parcel, then at his wife,
and gives it to the Tramp with decision</i>] Take it, you can
drink it on the way. [<i>To wife</i>] And you wanted to teach
me! [<i>To Tramp</i>] Go, you've been told to go. Then go,
and no palavering.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">TRAMP</span> [<i>takes parcel. Silence</i>] You think I don't understand.
[<i>His voice trembles</i>] I fully understand. Had you
beaten me like a dog, it would have felt less hard.
Don't I understand what I am? I am a rascal, a degenerate,
I mean. Forgive me for the Lord's sake. [<i>Sobs,
throws the parcel on the table, and goes out hurriedly</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320">320</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARTHA.</span> A good thing he didn't take the tea, or we
should have had none to drink.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MICHAEL</span> [<i>to wife</i>] And you wanted to teach me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NEIGHBOUR.</span> How he cried, poor soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">AKUL&Iacute;NA.</span> He too was a man.</p>
